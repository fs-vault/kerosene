A library of commonly used features across Firestarter's plugins, as well as a package of dependencies. Kerosene allows for easy playerdata access, a local SQLite database, and many other utility classes for things like teleportation, advancements, and economy. The goal is to create a library that can be easily updated across version updates, without having to change any part of the plugins that rely on it.
