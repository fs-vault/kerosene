A package of all dependencies and necessary libraries used across Firestarter plugins. 

Included within Kerosene are two MongoDB drivers (sync/async), Prometheus client, and a bunch of little utilities that keep the server ticking! We focus heavily on asynchronous programming, so the MongoDB async driver is included, with a sync driver as a backup.

Feel free to have a look at the code and modify it for your own purposes as you wish! âœ¨
