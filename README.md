# ðŸ”¥ Kerosene
A package of all dependencies and necessary libraries for Firestarter plugins. Included within Kerosene are two MongoDB drivers and a prometheus exporter. We focus heavily on asynchronous programming, so the MongoDB async driver is included, with a sync driver as a backup.

Feel free to have a look at the code and modify it for your own purposes as you wish! âœ¨
